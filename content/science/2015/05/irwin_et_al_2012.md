### Abbreviations

+ FRIGIDA - *FRI*
+ FLOWERING LOCUS C - *FLC*
+ FE SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE 2 - *FSD2* 

### Introduction

+ Vernalization requirement determines the life history strategy which plants
  adopt.
+ Flowering time influences the fitness of plants by affecting when plants set
  seed.
+ Flowering time also affects a number of agromonic traits by influencing the
  growth pattern of plants.
+ *FRI* gene expression represses flowering by promoting expression of *FLC*.

### Notes

+ 2 *FRI* genes identified in *Brassica oleracea*: *BolC.FRI.a* and
  *BolC.FRI.b*.
+ Sequence analysis of *Arabidopsis thaliana* *FRI* and its orthologues in
  other species has identified a conserved region of 37 amino acids in the
  N-terminal region of the protein.
+ Both *BolC.FRI.a* and *BolC.FRI.b* contain this conserved region, providing
  evidence for them being *FRI* orthologues.
+ *BolC.FRI.a* maps to *Brassica oleracea* chromosome C3 and *BolC.FRI.b* maps
  to chromosome C9.
+ The two regions where *BolC.FRI.a* and *BolC.FRI.b* map are syntenic with
  *Arabidopsis thaliana* chromosome 5, while *FRI* is located at the top of
  *Arabidopsis thaliana* chromosome 4.
+ The orthologue of *FRI* in *Arabidopsis lyrata* is found in a region of the
  genome which is homologous to *Arabidopsis thaliana* chromosome 5.
+ Within this region is an annotated gene model (AT5G51090), which shows
  homology to *FRI* and is likely to be a pseudogene, and *FSD2* (AT5G51100).
+ Propose that a recombination event relocated *FRI* in *Arabidopsis thaliana*
  from chromosome 5 to chromosome 4.
+ This event left a non-functional remnant of *FRI* in a genomic position on
  chromosome 5 which is syntenic with *FRI* in other Brassicaceae.
+ Across 55 varieties of *Brassica oleracea*, 2 common alleles were identified
  for *BolC.FRI.a*.
+ Both common alleles of *BolC.FRI.a* were able to complement *Arabidopsis
  thaliana* plants which were mutant in *FRI*, indicating that both are
  functional.
